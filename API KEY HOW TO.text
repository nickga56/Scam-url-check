Step-by-Step Guide to Get the Google Safe Browsing API Key

### Step 1: Go to Google Cloud Console
Open your browser and navigate to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/). Log in with your Google account.

### Step 2: Create a New Project
In the top navigation bar, click on "Select a project" and then click on "New Project". Provide a Project Name (e.g., "Scam Link Detector") and click "Create".

### Step 3: Enable the Safe Browsing API
In the left-hand menu, navigate to **APIs & Services** > **Library**. In the search bar, type "Safe Browsing API" and click on the result. Click the "Enable" button.

### Step 4: Create an API Key
Go to **APIs & Services** > **Credentials** in the left-hand menu. Click "Create Credentials" > **API Key**. Google will generate an API key for you. A pop-up will show the key. Copy the key and save it securely.

### Step 5: Restrict Your API Key (Recommended)
To prevent unauthorized use of your API key:

* On the Credentials page, find your API key in the list and click the pencil icon to edit it.
* Under **Application Restrictions**:
	+ Choose **HTTP referrers (websites)** if youâ€™re building a website, or **IP addresses** if using it for a Python script on a server.
	+ Add the allowed referrers (e.g., `http://localhost` during development or your production domain).
* Under **API Restrictions**:
	+ Select "Restrict key".
	+ Choose **Safe Browsing API** from the dropdown list.
	+ Click "Save".

### Step 6: Test the API Key
Use the key in your Python script or website to verify that it works.

### Tips for Working with the API Key
* **Security**: Never expose your API key in publicly accessible code repositories.
* **Monitoring**: Check usage in the **API & Services** > **Dashboard** section of the Cloud Console.
* **Quotas**: Google Safe Browsing API has a free tier, but it has usage limits. For higher limits, you may need to set up billing.
